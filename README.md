# Random_Forest
Random Forest Regression is a powerful technique used in machine learning for predicting continuous outcomes. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and averaging their predictions to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy. With its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and high-dimensional data, Random Forest Regression stands as a reliable method for modeling complex systems and making precise predictions in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and environmental science.
